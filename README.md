## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - For UI

### What I learned

I learned more about responsive web development.
The most challenign part was how to take the large screen design and make it responsive for mobile screens. I'm still learning how to make the design responsive for all screen sizes. There's probably a better way to do it than what I did.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about responsive web development. I believe there must be a system to take a desktop design and make it responsive for mobile screens.
